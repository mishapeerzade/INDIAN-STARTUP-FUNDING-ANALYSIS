## Data

* **Source**: The dataset originates from a `startup_funding.csv` file.
* **Contents**:

  * `date`: Funding date (converted to datetime, rows with missing dates dropped)
  * `industry_vertical`, `city/location`, `investors_name`: Categorical variables filled with defaults when missing
  * `amount_in_usd`: Numeric funding amount (commas and currency symbols removed, coerced to numeric)
* **Preprocessing Steps**:

  * Standardized column names (lowercase, underscores)
  * Handled missing values and data types as detailed in the code

These practices match the recommended data documentation strategies ([Cornell Data Services][1], [Georgia Tech Library][2]).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Required libraries:

  ```bash
  pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
  ```

### Running the Analysis

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Ensure `startup_funding.csv` is placed correctly (e.g., in the project root or specified directory).
3. Run the analysis script (e.g., `python analyze_funding.py`) or execute through a notebook.
4. Visualizations will display automatically, and recommendations will be printed to the console.

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Data cleanup**: Standardized naming, parsed dates, handled missing values, and cleaned numeric fields.
2. **Trend analysis**: Visualized monthly funding trends using `matplotlib`.
3. **Top categories**: Explored leading sectors, cities, startups, and investors via bar charts using `seaborn`.
4. **Investment type summary**: Visualized distribution of investment types.
5. **Recommendations**: Derived insights to guide investors and founders.

## Findings

* **Funding Trends**: Identified peaks and valleys in monthly total funding.
* **Dominant Sectors**: Top 10 industry verticals by funding count.
* **Hotspot Cities**: Key cities hosting the most funded startups.
* **Emerging Startups**: Leading startups by number of funding rounds.
* **Active Investors**: Investors with the highest activity.
* **Investment Types**: Most common categories (e.g., Seed, Angel, Venture).
